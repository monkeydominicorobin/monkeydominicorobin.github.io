<h1 class="romdom-header">twenty four years ago i learned to utilize
closed source technology like pc dos and ms dos command line
word processors similar to wordstar and wordperfect are my thing and
of course lotus 1-2-3 is for spreadsheets while vulcan is for database
but at present nobody would dare to use them for they are
deprecated and insignificant to the eyes of the merchants of cool</h1>

<h1 class="romdom-header">It was 1998 when I self-studied the use of the World Wide Web
It was the most exciting thing back then but as usual there
are too many malevolent websites that wastes your time and
they are practically telling us that they don't care if we
feel that way
